      <p>Introduction to Digital Studio Practice.</p>
      <p>Fall 2026.</p>
      <p>Within my practice as an artist I will admit that digital mediums often are not used outside of digital photography and for archival purposes. I much prefer the use of physical mediums and tend to focus on working on ink projects as well as sketches and paintings and even fiber arts. With my inkwork I do utilize digital mediums such as Adobe to scan all of my work for printing and archiving and then store the work both physically and digitally. Over the course of this semester I experimented and learned about several different mediums not previously at my disposal. I approached the medium from a timid yet interested angle as so much of it was new. I found a lot of the tools offered by Adobe to be useful. When approaching HTML I found interest in the complexity of it as well as the wide range of capabilities within programming and was especially interested in the possibilities to utilize it for archival purposes. The CSS side of website creation was my favorite portion to explore as it opened up so many different lanes for design.</p>

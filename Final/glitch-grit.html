      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>The Prompt for this project was to create a website housing glitched photos.</p>
      <h3>Tools</h3>
      <p>Visual Studio Codes</p>
      <h3>Process Documentation</h3>
      <p>HTML was completely new territory for me.</p>
      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>This project I found to be significantly more challenging than previous projects as it ventured into entirely new materials for me. HTML seemed to make sense in its layout however I ran into some minor syntax errors as well as formatting errors while creating the code for the site. I did find alot of interest in formatting the CSS of the code and choosing the images I would use for my project as well as altering the images of my cat that I included in the glitch project. Some of the typing did become tedious as I would have to double and triple check the lines of code since I was not as familiar with this program as I was with photoshop.</p>
